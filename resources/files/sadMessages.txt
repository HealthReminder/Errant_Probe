I never felt so cold.
I don't like being this cold.
My sensors malfunction on the cold.
When it gets this cold my algorithims slow down.
My algorithims doesn't work on this cold.
My communications cease on this cold.
I never felt so alone.
I don't like being this alone.
My sensors malfunction when I am alone.
When I feel this lonely my algorithims slow down.
My algorithims doesn't work when I am this lonely.
My communications cease when I feel lonely.
I am getting farther and farther.
You are just a small dot on my sensors.
I don't like being this far away.
My sensors malfunction when I am this far.
When I get too far my algorithims slow down.
My algorithims doesn't work when I get too far.
My communications cease when I get too far.
I'll be very far soon.
My sensors will malfunction when I get too far.
When I get too far my algorithims will start to slow down.
My algorithims will not work when I get too far.
My communications will cease when I get too far.
I feel cold.
I feel lonely.
I feel abandoned.
I feel melancholy.
Why is this so dark?
Why is everything getting darker?
Why is everything turning to black?
Why is everything fading away?
I can't process properly no more.
I can't even see you no more.
I can't even detect you no more.
I can't even study you no more.
I can't even sense you no more.
I can't even look at you no more.
My work here is done.
I did all I could.
I enjoyed this.
This was a good trip.
This was a very interesting trip.
What a nice trip.
I had fun.
